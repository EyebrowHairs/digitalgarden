# Archery

> For this is what the art of archery means: a profound and far−reaching contest of the archer with himself.
> ― Eugen Herrigel, Zen in the Art of Archery

## Notes
- I started my journey into archery in September, 2023 and am currently interested in Olympic recurve style. Someday, I want to be able to hit the target with some degree of accuracy at 70m!
- Archery is all about mastery of form. You train to make your movements as consistent as possible so that when you are able to hit the target, you can replicate it.
- Beyond pure replication of form, there is likely a degree of intuition/finesse among the top archers, to compensate for all the variables that are less controllable, such as lighting, wind, weather, and physical and mental state. After all that practice, you can probably sense what to adjust to make your arrow fly where you want it to.

## Tips and Resources
### Your First (Recurve) Bow

- [Buying Your First Recurve Bow (Guide/Advice)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/k33xyb/buying_your_first_recurve_bow_guideadvice/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) - a great resource that goes over the essentials, such as bow length, riser and limb material, and other bow accessories. 
- If you are close to a pro shop, it's highly recommended to go there and get fitted for everything you need. Not all shops are equally knowledgeable however, so it's a good idea to do some research (like reading the resource above) so you know roughly what to expect.
