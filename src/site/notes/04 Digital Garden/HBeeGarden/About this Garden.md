# About this Garden

I currently use the [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) tool to generate this digital garden. 

## How it works
It's essentially a website that uses your notes from [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (a notetaking app) as the content source. You specify which notes you want published by adding specific metadata (a.k.a. file properties) to each note. 

The site itself is hosted via a third-party (I use Vercel) and you can modify site settings using the plugin on the Obsidian app, or tweak the source code yourself.

## Features Wishlist
Some features I want to get around to configuring:
- [ ] Remove note icons
- [ ] Change the font
- [ ] Create a better favicon
- [ ] Change the TOC to be less indented
- [ ] Add light/dark mode toggles
