# Drawing

> Learning to draw is really a matter of learning to see – to see correctly – and that means a good deal more than merely looking with the eye.
> ― Kimon Nicolaides

> We all have 10,000 bad drawings in us. The sooner we get them out the better. 
> ― Walt Stanchfield
## Notes and Ramblings
- I have always wanted to learn how to draw better but I never really develop enough discipline to keep working at it. I think I would mostly like to draw little comics about life observations.
- I also like the idea of drawing fantasy worlds and environments
	- I've also had this comic idea for a while - based on mythological beings and forest dwellers
- I have a bit of a perfectionist streak, so drawing is one of those things where you can easily tell what's wrong (if you're trying to draw still-life)
- Perhaps I need to adopt a looser, interpretive style that suggests an idea, rather than perfectly imitating it.
- Also, I seem to have no qualms with accepting my screechy tone when first learning the violin, so why shouldn't it be the same case with drawing?
	- The act of drawing consistently leaves behind a memory which you can look back and constantly critique, whereas making music leaves behind a soundwave that rapidly dissipates into the air.
	- Although to counter this, I have taken video recordings of myself as a beginner, and videos leave behind much stronger memories than drawings
## Resources
- [Drawabox](https://drawabox.com/) - a popular resource that doesn't lie about the hard work involved in learning how to draw
	- I tried it a few years ago but gave up at the 250 Box Challenge
	- It uses a constructionist approach - so rather than drawing exactly what you see on the surface or outline (ex. studying the edges of a mug), you build a scaffold of fundamental shapes underlying the object (ex. a cylindrical shape). I think this approach is useful to draw more imaginatively as you can essential build imaginary objects.
