# 2023 Playlist

My musical finds throughout the year. 

I listen to a lot of classical music but sometimes it's hard to remember what the pieces are called, and there aren't exactly any lyrics to give you any hints. These playlists help to jog my memory and take a musical trip down memory lane.
## November 2023

1. [Bullfrog Jig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFbtRdDwaW0) - Louie Zong - A quirky little tune
2. [Concerto Del Sig. D. Antonio Vivaldi / RV 167 in B♭ major (Manuscript copy)](https://youtu.be/L1c8LhoHuQw?si=0FKy5DHbx3b4z006) - Del Vivaldi - Loving the introductory bit with the lute(?) and harpsichord
3. [Nemanja Radulović records Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61: III. Rondo (Allegro)](https://youtu.be/fFncnS7RAiI?si=gZrVAD_SGqhNawIQ) - Warner Classics - The music is great, but mostly, I love the video! It's always great to see musicians enjoying their craft.
4. [Hasse Sinfonia in G minor: Allegro I Tafelmusik I Francesco Corti](https://youtu.be/PKQkDTq5RsM?si=ooQyh5Nb2YOmzD_q) - Tafelmusik - An energizing piece! (fun fact: I attended this concert)
5. [John Williams - The Mission Suite Movements 1-4 (Themes to NBC Nightly News, Today & Meet the Press)](https://youtu.be/cqxNdtMpqUk?si=ockAUhpUm09h6Gmj) - Trevor Grismore - Reminds me of [Olympic Fanfare and Theme](https://youtu.be/WbQDpsx_6sU?si=9y8fEEYD56qyy28N), which John Williams also composed. They're both uplifting pieces!

## December 2023
1. [Cellogic](https://youtu.be/VFsY77RX03w?si=I9MKmKKevMzM4o3J) - 김현보, from "Boys Over Flowers" (a Korean drama) - This brings waves of nostalgia as I used to listen to this back in high school
2. [Beethoven Symphony No. 9 - Mvt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn4lk8fRskA) - Barenboim/West-Eastern Divan Orchestra - I briefly learned/struggled with the 2nd movement (2nd violin part) and gained an appreciation for it. Also it's fun to listen to!
3. [Chaconne of the Violin Partita BWV 1004 by J S Bach - D'Addario - Guitar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3W-SdpmUb5g) - Andrea De Vitis - originally for violin, this piece sounds like it was written for guitar. Both instruments bring their unique qualities to the piece. I feel like I can appreciate the notes and harmonies better when listening to guitar as it can breeze through chords and arpeggios, while the violin brings a haunting sense of struggle as it fights to play through the same parts. However, there is also a finer level of control as the violinist can control the duration of notes, whereas the guitarist must let notes fall away with every stroke.
4. [Johann Sebastian Bach - Chaconne, Partita No. 2 BWV 1004](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngjEVKxQCWs) - Hilary Hahn - my favourite version of the Chaconne on violin
