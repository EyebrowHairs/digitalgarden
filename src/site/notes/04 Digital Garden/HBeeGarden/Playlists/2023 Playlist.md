# 2023 Playlist

My musical finds throughout the year. 

I listen to a lot of classical music but sometimes it's hard to remember what the pieces are called, and there aren't exactly any lyrics to give you any hints. These playlists help to jog my memory and take a musical trip down memory lane.
## November 2023

1. [Bullfrog Jig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFbtRdDwaW0) - Louie Zong - A quirky little tune
2. [Concerto Del Sig. D. Antonio Vivaldi / RV 167 in B♭ major (Manuscript copy)](https://youtu.be/L1c8LhoHuQw?si=0FKy5DHbx3b4z006) - Del Vivaldi - Loving the introductory bit with the lute(?) and harpsichord
3. [Nemanja Radulović records Beethoven: Violin Concerto in D Major, Op. 61: III. Rondo (Allegro)](https://youtu.be/fFncnS7RAiI?si=gZrVAD_SGqhNawIQ) - Warner Classics - The music is great, but mostly, I love the video! It's always great to see musicians enjoying their craft.
4. [Hasse Sinfonia in G minor: Allegro I Tafelmusik I Francesco Corti](https://youtu.be/PKQkDTq5RsM?si=ooQyh5Nb2YOmzD_q) - Tafelmusik - An energizing piece! (fun fact: I attended this concert)
5. [John Williams - The Mission Suite Movements 1-4 (Themes to NBC Nightly News, Today & Meet the Press)](https://youtu.be/cqxNdtMpqUk?si=ockAUhpUm09h6Gmj) - Trevor Grismore - Reminds me of [Olympic Fanfare and Theme](https://youtu.be/WbQDpsx_6sU?si=9y8fEEYD56qyy28N), which John Williams also composed. They're both uplifting pieces!
